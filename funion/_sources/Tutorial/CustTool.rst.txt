Most time,the default tool in toolbar cannot meet our request,so we need to customize tool.
For example by KUKA,we can use 4-points method and 2-points method to get the parameter of tool,namely XYZABC.
The detail operation of 4-points method and 2-points method will not be introduced here,you can search them in internet.
By previous operations,we can get XYZABC parameter in robot pad,then we input them to custom tool component:


Load tool model
--------------------------------------------

In Rhino,load the finished mesh model(in CustomTool.3dm),make sure that the **flange plane of tool is align to world plane.**

Take a mesh component,pick up this tool model:

Create a Custom tool component,and connect the previous components:

Customize tool
--------------------------------------------
Then a custom tool is finished,you can replace the tool of Getting Started with this custom tool:

Keep the XYZABC parameter,the newly done tool can also be used for ABB and UR robots.

.. note::
    If the tool parameter is from UR robot,then you should use URToolDataToXYZABC for convertion（ABB is similar）:
