Customize KUKA&ABB Robot
============================================

.. note::
    Document of this tutorial is CustomizeRobot.3dm , CustomizeRobot.gh | Downlaod in Github_

.. _Github: https://github.com/fabunion/FURDocTutorial

FUROBOT supports several type of robot,but still a lot of robot cannot be included.
So we provide customize robot component for KUKA and ABB(UR is all included).
The method to customize the robot is same in ABB and KUKA,so we provide a example on ABB(IRB 120):

Load Robot model
--------------------------------------------

In Rhino,load the finished robot mesh model(in CustomizeRobot.3dm)
This model is from ABB official download center

Robot element and Robot part
--------------------------------------------

Select the base mesh,and put it into a mesh component(you can hide other robot mesh meanwhile):

.. image:: img/R0.png

Create a "Robotmesh" for this base,because its colour is black,so we input a "Colour" swatch component.

.. image:: img/R0a.png

.. note::
    RobotMesh is a minimum element for customizing robot,it has colour and mesh.

This base element belongs to base part.

.. note::
    Robot part is the minimum element for robot kinetics.

Base part can contain many robot elements in one time,but in base part,it only contains one element.
So we can just connect previous robot mesh to this robot part:

.. image:: img/R0b.png

Then connect the robot part to ABB customize robot component:

.. image:: img/R0c.png

Then we do the same thing to R1 part:

.. image:: img/R1.png

Because the R1 part is for rotation,so it must has a limit,we can find this limit from ABB official download center:

.. image:: img/Limit.png

So,R1's limit is -165~165 degrees,we add this limit to robot part:

.. image:: img/R1Limit.png

Connect
--------------------------------------------

Then we connect this R1 part to customize robot component's R1 input.
And do other part like these steps.

Then we go to ABB offical download center to get the CAD document of this kind ABB:

.. image:: img/ABBCAD.png

Then put the numbers into customize robot component:

.. image:: img/ABBNum.png

One thing should be mentioned: in R4 robot part,it also contains a black ABB Logo,so we need to add additional robot mesh to
represent this logo:

Finally,we add the tool and commands to core component,and get the result:
