Customize EA
============================================

When we buy or make a new external axis device,we need to get a same external axis device in
FUROBOT. 

Load external axis model
--------------------------------------------

  In Rhino,load the finished mesh model ( in CustomEA.3dm )

.. note::
    There are one square mesh,one big rectanglar mesh,one point,one curve in the scene:

The rectanglar mesh is stationary,the squrae can move along Y axis of world coordinate.

External axis parts
--------------------------------------------

so,What is external axis parts ?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
is the moving part which contains:

 * Mesh model : Model of the element.
  
 * Moving direction : Direction vector of the moving part.
  
 * Value ID : In offline program ,the value ID is the ID to represent the moving part.
  
 * Value limitation interval : Value limit of moving.
  
 * Is coupling or note : When the moving parts's moving value cannot be recognized by robot,this means No coupling.
  
 * Material : Material of the element.
  

For example,the rectanglar mesh:

 * Has a mesh.
 * No direction because it is stationary.
 * Value ID should be set to **0** ,because no value to control it's moving.
 * No value limit.
 * Is coupling or not,which is not important.
 * Has a Material.

So we can define this part in FUROBOT:

Also, we can define the second part:

Finally,we combine these parts into ``CustomEA component``:

**One important thing** is: ``Plane input`` accept a plane when the all external 
value is **Zero** ,it also can be called **Initial plane**.In this example,this plane
is in the **top center** of square mesh.

if everything is OK,viewport shows:

.. note::
    In FUROBOTï¼Œthe unit of ``direction vector`` of ``External axis part`` is **mm**.
    It means,if you use unit vector(length=1),the moving length is **1mm**,so you should 
    be care of the lenght of ``direction vector``.
